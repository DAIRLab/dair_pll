## Attribution notes
* The GitHub Action documentation build scripts are based on [Anne Gentle](https://github.com/annegentle)'s great example here: https://github.com/annegentle/create-demo
* Some functions (such as [`rotation_matrix_from_one_vector`](https://dairlab.github.io/dair_pll/dair_pll.tensor_utils.html#dair_pll.tensor_utils.rotation_matrix_from_one_vector)) are Pytorch reimplementations of [drake](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake) functionality, and are attributed accordingly in their documentation.
* This code contains a repackaged version of the Manifold Unscented Kalman Filter developed by [Martin Brossard et al.](https://github.com/CAOR-MINES-ParisTech/ukfm)
